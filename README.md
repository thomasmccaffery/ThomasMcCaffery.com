Version 4 of my Digital Portfolio

===================

A stripped down (images not included) version of my current portfolio.  

Flexibly designed to fit any size, big or small, with vary block layouts based on screen width.  Most work was put to making it CSS3 only, however some Javascript was unfortunately necessary.
